## Implementation

Experimenting with the Berkeleytime site, it looks like terms like “cs70” register well with the search engine.

Course ID/number indexing is already developed and should be #1 priority in the algorithm.

- Users won’t look up anything different from cs70, 70, etc when looking for a specific course.
- It also looks like course popularity is properly indexed for. Should be prioritized with course/number indexing

Secondary to this should be keyword based semantic search indexing.

Specialized Berkeley terms like cs70 should not be considered within semantic indexing and must be considered separately in the first step. These should be given priority within search.

Keyword Based SS Index Pipeline:

1. Preprocessing:
    1. Text normalization
        1. Convert text to lowercase, remove stopwords, punctuation, special characters
        2. Tokenization: Break down the text into individual tokens
        3. Stemming/Lemmatization (important): Reduce words to their base forms (e.g. “running” -> “run”)
2. Synonym Expansion
    1. Synonym dictionary integration for search terms using WordNet
3. Entity Recognition + Contextual Understanding + Indexing
    1. BERT will be used for this.
4. Ranking
